The Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program is a summer initiative that advocates for women in tech, aiming to educate young girls about computer science. In this self-paced program, requiring independent time management, participants engage with modules covering the basics of programming languages and learn about influential women in the technology industry, exploring their life journeys in tech.

Actively contributing to hands-on coding projects, including quizzes, basic websites, and applications, has significantly strengthened my understanding of coding languages, proving invaluable in my academic journey. Beyond programming, the self-paced aspect of the program has taught me crucial skills in active learning and time management, essential attributes for my future career. Taking responsibility for my education and success in the program underscored the importance of self-directed learning, a lesson applicable to various aspects of life.

This experience has been a profound learning opportunity. It marked my first real encounter with applying to a program, involving tasks such as creating resumes, essays, and sending transcripts, essential skills for college, scholarship, and internship applications. The skills acquired during the application process have undoubtedly facilitated subsequent endeavors. Learning basic programming languages like HTML and CSS provided a foundational understanding that proved beneficial when encountering these concepts in an academic setting. However, the most significant takeaway from this experience is the development of self-directed learning and effective time management skills, laying a strong foundation for success as a college student and beyond.
