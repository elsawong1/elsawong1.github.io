Academia Arena: ICS Edition is a combination the excitment of collecting trading cards with the world of academia at University of Hawaii at Manoa, particular in the ICS department. The goal of our web application  is to help incoming students or continuing ICS students, especially those who feel disconnected from their professors, connect with them and learn about them more easily.Each card features a different professor, complete with unique stats, abilities, and fun facts.  

In this project, my main contribution was the implementation of a wishlist feature. Users can now browse through the catalog of professor cards and heart the ones they like to add them to their wishlist. Thus allows users to keep track of the cards they are interested in, making it eaiser for them to manage their collections and plans for future trades. 

From this experience, I have learned the valuable lesson of buiilding a functional web application using different software engineering tools such a meteor and the database, MongoDB. I learned how to structure and manage data effectively within a database, as well as how to integrate database functionality into a web application. Additionally, since this was a group project, I also gained experience in agile project management. Collaborating with team members and organizing tasks using agile principles and using GitHub's project management features helped us stay organized and focused throughout the development process.
