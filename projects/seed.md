SEƐD (STEAM. Exploration. 3D. Design.) is a newly established RIO at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, led by students with the purpose of creating a safe space for individuals to explore STEAM disciplines and engage in 3D printing and design. Our overarching goal is to utilize these disciplines for community service initiatives that contribute to the betterment of our local community. Founded by my friend and me, SEƐD emerged from a shared desire to explore our interests without reservation and to learn collectively while making a positive impact on the community.

In my role as Co-Founder and current Co-President of SEƐD, I have been involved since the club's start, navigating through administrative channels to understand the process of creating the club and seeing it come to life. As a leader, I oversee our officers and facilitate communication with various UH Manoa departments to attract members and ensure the club's success.

While SEƐD is farily new, I think I have learned the most from it.  I've gained insights into effective leadership, from the mountains of paperwork and communcation between members, officers, and various departments at University of Hawaii at Manoa. Overall, SEƐD has not only allowed me to explore my interests but has also been a rich source of learning about leadership, organization, and the operational aspects of running a student-led club.
